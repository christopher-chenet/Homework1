1.	Given the provided data we can conclude that over half the campaigns are successful, and that about 40% are either failed or canceled, and less than 10% were live. We can also say that of all the venues the plays had the most concentrated numbers in both success and failure.
2.	There was no data on whether the goers were satisfied with their experience.
3.	We could use bar graphs instead of line graphs because they can provide a better picture of where the numbers are concentrated.
4.	The median would be better to summarize the data because of the high variability of the data would make the mean significantly higher than where a large portion of the data is concentrated.
